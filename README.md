# SQLite-batch-statements

Benchmarking regular statements and batches in SQLite.

## Running benchmarks

### Using the rust SDK

```sh
cargo run --example <example-name> # e.g batch, batch_remote, stmt, stmt_remote
```

### Using the JS/TS SDK

Install npm dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

Run individual tests:

```sh
npm run batch # batch, batch:remote, stmt, stmt:remote 
```

## Testing the constraints of interactive transactions

Run interactive transaction:

```sh
npm run antipat:interactive
```

Then, pass a value >10000 or time in miliseconds that's enough for you to run the proceeding ðŸ‘‡ example.

While the above interactive transaction is ongoing, run the following command:

```sh
npm run antipat:regular
```
